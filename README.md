## SemAxis: A Lightweight Framework to Characterize Domain-Specific Word Semantics Beyond Sentiment

Authors: Jisun An, Haewoon Kwak, and Yong-Yeol Ahn

### Abstract
Because word semantics can substantially change across communities and contexts, capturing domain-specific word semantics is an important challenge. 
Here, we propose *SemAxis*, a simple yet powerful framework to characterize word semantics using many semantic axes in word-vector spaces beyond sentiment. We demonstrate that *SemAxis* can capture nuanced semantic representations in multiple online communities. We also show that, when the sentiment axis is examined, *SemAxis* outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in building domain-specific sentiment lexicons.
